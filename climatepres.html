    <h1>2020 Presidential Candidates and their stance on Climate Change</h1>
<img src="pres.all.jpg" style="width:100%;height:50%;">
    No dem candidate denies human-caused climate change
    2016 Climate change got 5.5 mins of debate time
    2020 so far 40 mins
    69% voting age Americans are worried and ⅓ VERY worried, highest percent ever recorded
    Democartic voters care more about climate change than about any other issue in the 2020 election
    “That kind of pressure is already getting results; even before the new polling, Democratic candidates were pledging their support for dramatic action. Several, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, have come out strongly against allowing federal land to be used for oil and gas drilling—a “Keep It in the Ground” stance that, until a few months ago, was mainly the province of activists.” - Bill McKibben
    A majority of registered voters (63%) are worried about global warming, including 88% of liberal Democrats, 76% of moderate/conservative Democrats, and 58% of liberal/moderate Republicans, but only 30% of conservative Republicans. Worry about global warming has increased among liberal/moderate Republicans by 15 percentage points since May 2017 and by seven points among conservative Republicans since October 2017.
