    <h1>Here are the facts you <em>need</em> to know</h1>

    Climate Crisis: Statistics:

The earth's average temperature has risen 1.9 degrees since the late 19th century
Our oceans have absorbed .4 degrees fahrenheit since 1969
*Antartica has lost 127 billion tons of ice per year since 1993-2016 and that number has tripled since then and Greenland has lost 286 billion tons of ice between the years 1993-2016.

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the acidity of the ocean water has increased by 30%.
The sea level is rising 3.3 millimeters per year, that is 1.3 inches every decade.
The global sea level has risen 8 inches in the last century.
The levels of carbon dioxide are currently 408 parts per million which haven't been so high in 3 million years
*11% of emissions are due to deforestation, an average of 3.5-7 billions trees per year, that's the same as the population of the entire earth.

*The ocean acidity has decreased in .1 pH since the industrial revolution, making it more acidic. In humans, a decrease in pH of .2-.3 could cause seizures, comas and even death. Imagine the effects that could do to the entire oceanâ€¦

*800 million people are affected by climate change effects such as flooding, heat waves, droughts and much more, that is more than the entire population of europe.

With the horrendous effects of climate change creeping up on us, we are realizing the limited time we have to take action and preserve our precious earth. If we all work together on this earth, we can make a change which will keep generations thriving on this luscious planet for years to come.
